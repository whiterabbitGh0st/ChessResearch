Research of my chess games

Attempting to answer the following questions based on my own chess games:
 - Is there any correlation with my play and my rating? 
 - Is my play getting better/worse over time? 
 - Are there discernable differences in the quality of my play across different formats (Rapid, Blitz, 960)
 - Using other statistical methods to answer questions related to the distributions of my ACL (Average Centipawn Loss) to answer other pertinent questions.
