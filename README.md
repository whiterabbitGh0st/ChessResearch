This project is intended to be a deep dive into the quality of my personal chess games from Lichess. I use the lichess analysis feature to ascertain the ACL (Average Centipawn Loss) for each game and attempt to analyze each game that I play and record the results in a drive spreadsheet. I'm truly not sure what I'll find out but I have some preliminary questions that I am trying to answer. Surely more questions will arise as I continue this research but I am initially interested in answering the following:
 - Is there any correlation with my play and my rating? 
 - Is my play getting better/worse over time? 
 - Are there discernable differences in the quality of my play across different formats (Rapid, Blitz, 960)
 - Using other statistical methods to answer questions related to the distributions of my ACL (Average Centipawn Loss) to answer other pertinent questions.
